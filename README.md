For this Creative Project I will be making a website for a fictitious animal shelter.

It contains:
- A home page with general information about the shelter such as location.
- An about page which goes more into the principles and origin of the shelter.
- An adoption page which asks if you want a cat or a dog with pictures acting as links to those pages.
- A cat adoption page that will display the animals up for adoption and general information about each animal.
- A dog adoption page that will display the animals up for adoption and general information about each animal.

A foster page might be added later but it is not guaranteed.
