For this Creative Project I will be making a website for a fictitious animal shelter.

It contains:
	- A home page with general information about the shelter such as location.
	- An about page which goes more into the principles and origin of the shelter.
	- An adoption page which will display the animals up for adoption and general information about each animal.
	- A review page which highlights a few success stores from the shelter.

A foster page might be added later but it is not guaranteed.
